# Multi-Tenant RBAC System - Executive Summary

## Overview

This document presents a comprehensive multi-tenant Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system designed to provide secure, scalable, and flexible access management across multiple tenants in the RevSoc platform.

## Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
- Users can belong to multiple tenants simultaneously
- Each user can have different roles in different tenants
- Seamless tenant switching without re-authentication
- Complete data isolation between tenants

### 2. **5-Level Role Hierarchy**
- **Super Admin** (Level 1): Platform-wide control
- **Owner** (Level 2): Full tenant control
- **Admin** (Level 3): Tenant management
- **Analyst** (Level 4): Data analysis and reporting
- **Viewer** (Level 5): Read-only access

### 3. **Granular Permission System**
- Role-based permissions
- Tenant-scoped access control
- Hierarchical permission inheritance
- Audit trail for all actions

        C --> D[Permission Grant]
        D --> E[Resource Access]
    end

    end
```

## Core Workflows

### 1. User Authentication & Tenant Selection

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | User logs in with credentials | Authentication token generated |
| 2 | System fetches user's assigned tenants | List of available tenants |
| 3 | User selects or auto-selects tenant | Tenant context established |
| 4 | System loads tenant-specific role | Permissions activated |
| 5 | User accesses tenant resources | Role-based access enforced |

### 2. Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Can Create Users | Can Manage Tenants | Can Access Data | Can Configure |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Super Admin | All roles, any tenant | Create, modify, delete | All tenants | Everything |
| Owner | Admin, Analyst, Viewer | Modify own tenant | Own tenant | Own tenant |
| Admin | Analyst, Viewer | View only | Own tenant | Own tenant |
| Analyst | Cannot create | View only | View & analyze | View only |
| Viewer | Cannot create | View only | View only | No access |

### 3. User Management Permissions

    E -->|Cannot create| F
```

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `users` | User accounts | id, email, username, is_super_admin |
| `tenants` | Tenant organizations | id, tenant_code, tenant_name, status |
| `roles` | System roles | id, role_name, level, scope |
| `user_tenant_roles` | User-tenant mappings | user_id, tenant_id, role_id |
| `permissions` | Granular permissions | id, permission_name, resource, action |
| `audit_logs` | Activity tracking | action, user_id, tenant_id, timestamp |

### Key Relationships

1. **Users ↔ Tenants**: Many-to-many through `user_tenant_roles`
2. **Users ↔ Roles**: One role per user per tenant
3. **Roles ↔ Permissions**: Many-to-many relationship
4. **All Actions → Audit Logs**: Complete audit trail

## Security Features

### 1. **Access Control**
- JWT-based authentication with tenant context
- Permission verification at API level
- Frontend permission gates
- Role hierarchy enforcement

### 2. **Data Protection**
- Complete tenant data isolation
- Row-level security in database
- Encrypted authentication tokens
- Secure session management

### 3. **Audit & Compliance**
- All actions logged with user, timestamp, and tenant
- Immutable audit trail
- Export capabilities for compliance
- Real-time monitoring support

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. **Scalability**
- Supports unlimited tenants
- Efficient permission checking
- Optimized database queries
- Minimal performance overhead

### 2. **Flexibility**
- Easy to add new roles
- Customizable permissions
- Tenant-specific configurations
- Extensible architecture

### 3. **User Experience**
- Seamless tenant switching
- Clear role indicators
- Intuitive permission model
- Consistent UI/UX

### 4. **Administration**
- Centralized user management
- Bulk operations support
- Self-service capabilities
- Comprehensive reporting

## Key Metrics & Constraints

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Max roles per system | Unlimited | 5 default roles provided |
| Max tenants per user | Unlimited | Typically 1-10 |
| Max users per tenant | Unlimited | Based on plan |
| Permission check time | <10ms | Cached for performance |
| Audit retention | Configurable | Default 90 days |
| Token expiry | 24 hours | Configurable |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Privilege escalation | Role hierarchy enforcement, audit logging |
| Data leakage | Tenant isolation, permission checks |
| Unauthorized access | JWT validation, session management |
| Audit tampering | Immutable logs, separate storage |
| Performance impact | Caching, optimized queries |
